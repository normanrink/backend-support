## Compiler backend support for memory error detection

The LLVM x86 backend has been extended so that machine code can be generated that is capable of detecting bit-flip errors in memory.
Error detection relies on _dual modular redundancy (DMR)_, i.e. values stored in memory and memory accesses are duplicated.
This duplication is only applied to memory accesses that are generated by the compiler backend,
e.g. for function activation records or for register spills.
It is assumed that another error detection mechanism or, more generally, fault tolerance scheme is applied at a higher level of program representation,
e.g. at the level of LLVM IR or as a source-to-source transformation.

More detailed motivation for extending a compiler backend with this kind of error detection mechanism is given in the  accompanying technical report
[Comprehensive Backend Support for Local Memory Fault Tolerance](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:bsz:14-qucosa-215785).
The report also describes the complete rationale behind each individual extension of the LLVM x86 backend and
evaluates the usefulness and performance impact of generating machine code for memory error detection.

### Getting started

This project is built in exactly the same way as the standard [LLVM project](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html).
Please also refer to the standard readme for the LLLVM project, i.e. the file README.txt in the current folder,
and the [LLVM project homepage](https://llvm.org/).
